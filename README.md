Hello! Welcome to my repository! This is where I will store my small projects that I have self-studied.

Here are the current folders:
1) Download_files_from_URL: This is a process done using Laiye Automation, an RPA software. The process will go into this URL - https://www.markmorrisinstitute.org/sacn5_download.html - and scrape out each of the chapter names along with the PDF URL for each of the chapters. THen, it will navigate to the PDF page and downlaod the PDF, renaming the file into the chapter number and title.
2) Dog_Adoption_Webpage: This is a HTML page that I did a few years ago when learning HTML/CSS from an online course
3) Python_Telegram_GoogleCalendar: Every month, I will collate my activities from Google Calendar and send it in a Telegram chat to my friends. I decided to use Python to automate this process to make it more time efficient! The process will loop through a user-defined month/year, extract out the activities, group them according to date, and then send it out via a Telegram bot.
4) Python_Strava_GoogleSheets: My dog goes for hydrotherapy once in a few weeks. Usually, I will records his walks using Strava, and then manually collate them for his hydrotherapist. I created this Python process to search in Google Sheets for the last instance of the word "Hydro", find all the walks on Strava that are on and after that date, group the walks into Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night, and then insert it into my Google Sheet.
